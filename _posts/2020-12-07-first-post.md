### Welcome!
My plan is to write about anything that would be benefical to other engineers out in the field, or for those that are just wanting to learn about automaion, Python, networking or even some random things that come to my mind.

I know there isn't much here, but it is my first post and I'm just getting started. I think in my next post I will go over a script that I wrote to pull Firewall Policy Hit Counters across numerous Juniper SRX firewalls, and then export those to a CSV file, I even had the ability for it to output the commands to delete the policies if you'd like. This was helpful to pull policies that hadn't been hit in a long time and in turn cleanup the firewall and not leave any potential holes out there. Now I will run this in a lab environment using EVE-NG which I purchased during Black Friday, was able to grab an 18 month license for **75%** of the 1 year price!
