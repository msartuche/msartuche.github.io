Welcome to my blog.

My name is Mike Sartuche and I'm currently a Senior Network Engineer at Appriss. I decided to write this blog to help those in the community of network automation, along with whatever other topic peaks my interest.

Current Experience:

- Python (3+ Years)
- PHP (8+ years)
- Networking (14+)
- Everything else, only time will tell.

### Networking wasn't my first choice

I didn't start out in the IT field but actually started in the medical field as a Surgical Technologist. I was in this profession for roughly 6 years until I could no longer handle the prolonged standing. It was in 2005 when I decided I needed to pick a new profession. I've always enjoyed video games, and computers so I thought to myself, why not get a job in IT. June 2005 is when I enrolled at ITT (**I know, I know**) but no matter what you've heard, I actually received a descent education and had some very bright instructors, some of them work for DHS, Cisco and other large companies now. 

After starting my journey towards my Bachelors Degree, I got my first job as a High Speed Data Specialist (Glorified Internet Help Desk), for Charter Communications. I did this for about 6 months until I was given a chance to work as a NOC Engineer, but it was more of a Network Engineer position. This was my first Networking job and I got to experience the world of VoIP, FYI I hate FoIP or Fax over IP, it's horrible, but anyways. After starting this new position I realized how much I truly enjoyed networking and 4 months later I got my CCNA, passed it on the first try (barely), but a pass nonetheless.

Needless to say I've had other positions throughout my career and I'm always looking for the next challenge, I truly enjoy my current position because I feel like I make a difference where I'm at, [Appriss](https://www.appriss.com) is a wonderful company that was born out of a tragedy unfortunately, but out of the tragedy was birthed [VINE](https://vinelink.com/#what-is-vine), which allows victims to receive notifications for inmates that they register to monitor such as if the person is released, has a court hearing or any change in their status. By providing notifications to victims once an inmates status changes, it allows the victim the opportunity to go somewhere safe. 

I'm sure I'll add to this page as more thing's come to me, but thanks for taking the time to read it.
